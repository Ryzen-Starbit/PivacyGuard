# 🛡️ PrivacyGuard – AI Desktop Privacy Monitoring System

PrivacyGuard is an intelligent desktop security application that protects your screen from unauthorized viewers by continuously monitoring the surroundings using computer vision.

Unlike traditional screen-locking software, PrivacyGuard actively detects suspicious activity such as shoulder surfing, unknown faces and user absence. It provides real-time alerts, automatically captures faces and helps users maintain privacy while working in public or shared environments.

## 📌 Problem

Modern laptops contain sensitive personal and professional information, yet they remain vulnerable to:

- Shoulder surfing attacks
- Unauthorized screen viewing
- Identity theft
- Privacy leakage in public places
- Lack of intelligent monitoring while users are away

PrivacyGuard addresses these challenges using AI-powered face detection, gaze tracking, and real-time threat analysis.
